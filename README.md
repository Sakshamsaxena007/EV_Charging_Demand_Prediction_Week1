# EV Charging Demand Prediction – AICTE Internship Cycle 2 (S4F)

This repository contains my complete project for the **AICTE Government Internship (S4F)**.  
The project focuses on predicting Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand using historical EV registration data.

## Project Contents
- EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb` – Final source code with data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and predictions
- Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv` – Original dataset
- preprocessed_ev_data.csv` – Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- forecasting_ev_model.pkl` – Trained Random Forest Regressor model
- RF_Tree.png – Visualization outputs
- app.py
- ev-car-factory.jpg
- requirements.txt

## Project Workflow
1. Data collection & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualization  
3. Model training using Random Forest Regressor  
4. Model evaluation and saving as `.pkl`  
5. Predictions and visualizations for EV charging demand

## LMS Submission
The final PPT and notebook have been submitted to LMS for **Week 3 Final Submission**.  
This GitHub repository contains all source files for evaluation and verification.
